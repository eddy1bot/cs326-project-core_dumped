## Application Idea
My initial idea is to create an application which allows users a simple way
to maintain control over their finances. This application, ideally, will
interact with some form of an off-system database which will store information
regarding user 'virtual accounts', paychecks, income, expendatures, etc.
I am currently using a fairly complicated excel spreadsheet to manage my
personal finances, and over the years I have desired to share this system
with friends and family, however, it is extremely inaccessable and overly
complicated. I hope to design a web application which provides a clean and
inviting UI, but is backed with the efficacy of the existing spreadsheet design.


## Functionality
I don't know enough about databases to know how they work, but I am hoping
to learn throughout this class. If a database isn't an option, then as an
alternative, I may end up using a file which would be stored on the users
computer and could be accessed directly by the application.
The application should allow users to provide information regarding their
expected expendatures in the initial set up process. Then as regular use of
the application begins, the application should be able to take a paycheck as
input, display to the user their expendatures, display remaining funds after
expendatures are accounted for, provide an interface for users to input
expendatures throughout their pay cycle as they occur, and update the funds
remaining as expendatures are noted. Additionally, as paychecks are inputed,
the amount specified by the user should be detracted from the paycheck and
added to the 'balance' of the desired virtual account. This will allow users to
partition individual bank accounts into several 'virtual accounts' which are
kept track of through the application log. This way, despite the funds being
pooled together in the bank account, the application can specify exactly how
much of that lump sum has been earmarked for any given purpose (virtual account)
